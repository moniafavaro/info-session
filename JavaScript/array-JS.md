## Array

An array is an object that can store multiple values at once:
```js
const cars = ["Mini", "Range Rover", "BMW"];
```
<br />

We can store in a array details about a person, like name, surname, age and height:
```js
const person = ["Albus","Dumbledore", 115, 1.85]
```
<br />

You access an array element by referring to theÂ index number:
```js
const cars = ["Mini", "Range Rover", "BMW"];
let car = cars[0];
```
<br />

> Note: Array indexes start with 0. [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.
